# Operating Environment – Original Linux Implementation

Welcome to the original Linux‑based version of **Operating Environment** (OE). This repository contains the complete source code history of the project, from its first release in 2020 through various stable and development builds. OE is a console‑based “operating environment” built as a hobby project, featuring multiple built‑in applications, user management, a registry system, and a command‑driven shell.

## Repository Structure

- **`Stable Releases/`** – Officially released versions, each in its own folder with source files and a README detailing the changes.
- **`Under_dev Builds/`** – Development snapshots and experimental builds that were never formally released.

All code is written in C++ (with some C‑style elements) and relies on Linux system calls and ANSI escape sequences for console control. No external libraries are used.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a historical archive, showing the evolution of the project from a simple quiz app into a feature‑rich environment. It is preserved here to document the journey and to provide a foundation for future work (see the `oe-reboot` repository for the modern, platform‑independent rewrite in C).

Feel free to explore, learn from, or even run any of these versions (if you have a Linux environment or compatible terminal). Each folder contains a README with specific instructions and highlights.
