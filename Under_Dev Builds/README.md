**Experimental snapshots and work‑in‑progress versions from the development history**

*These builds were never officially released – they represent the cutting edge (and occasional bleeding edge) of the project's evolution.*

## 🌟 Overview

The **Under_dev Builds** folder contains intermediate snapshots taken during active development. These versions were never packaged for public release; they are preserved here for historical reference and to show the iterative process behind the stable releases. They may contain:

- Partially implemented features
- Debugging code
- Unstable behaviour or bugs
- Experimental ideas that were later refined or abandoned

## 📁 Build Structure

```
📁 Under_dev Builds/
├── 📁 v4.05.11/      # Post‑v4.05.08 development snapshot
├── 📁 v4.05.12/      # Further refinements and experiments
└── 📁 v4.23.09/      # Later development, possibly leading to a future release
```

Each folder includes the source files as they existed at that point in time, along with a brief README describing the state of the build and any notable changes from the previous stable version.

## 🔬 What to Expect

- **Incomplete features** – Some functions may be stubs or not work as intended.
- **Debug output** – Extra print statements or logging may clutter the console.
- **Unstable behaviour** – The environment might crash or behave unexpectedly.
- **Experimental code** – You might find alternative implementations, new ideas, or tests.

These builds are **not recommended for general use** – they are provided for educational purposes and to document the development process.

## 📝 Build Details

### v4.05.11
- **Date:** [Insert approximate date, e.g., late 2021]
- **Focus:** Likely refinements to the settings app or registry editor.
- **Status:** Unfinished; may contain bugs.

### v4.05.12
- **Date:** [Insert date]
- **Focus:** Further work on the same features, perhaps with new experiments.
- **Status:** Possibly more stable than v4.05.11, but still a development snapshot.

### v4.23.09
- **Date:** [Insert date]
- **Focus:** Later development, maybe targeting a v5.0 that was never completed.
- **Status:** The most advanced but also the most experimental.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Use at your own risk.** These builds are not guaranteed to work correctly.
- **No support is provided** for running or debugging these versions.
- They are preserved purely as historical artefacts – to see how ideas evolved before becoming stable features.
- If you find something interesting or usable, feel free to explore, but expect the unexpected.
